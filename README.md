# Real-estate-office-management-software

For my final project in the Object-Oriented Programming course, I developed a comprehensive system to manage a real estate office using Java. This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to ensure a structured and efficient implementation.

In the Model package, I organized all the logic classes that embody the core functionality of the system. By adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming, I designed these classes to represent real-world entities and implemented their behavior accordingly.

In the Controller package, I placed a class that serves as the intermediary between the View and the Model. This class handles user input, communicates with the Model to perform necessary operations, and updates the View accordingly.

The View package contains classes responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI). These classes enable users to interact with the system, display relevant information, and provide a seamless user experience.

By adopting the MVC architectural pattern, I achieved a clear separation of concerns, facilitating maintainability and extensibility of the system. The Model encapsulates the business logic, the Controller handles the flow of data and user actions, and the View ensures an intuitive and visually appealing presentation of information.

Through the effective utilization of Java and the application of object-oriented programming principles, my real estate office management system provides a robust and user-friendly solution for efficient real estate operations.
